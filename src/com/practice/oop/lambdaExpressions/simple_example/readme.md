# Lambda Expressions Simple Example

This README provides an overview of the Java code in the `com.practice.oop.lambdaExpressions.simple_example` package. The code demonstrates the usage of lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and traditional anonymous inner class implementations.

## MainClass

The `MainClass` contains the `main` method, where various lambda expressions and functional interfaces are used for demonstration purposes.

## OldMainClass

The `OldMainClass` demonstrates the old method of implementing an interface using an anonymous inner class.

## A

The `A` interface is marked as a `FunctionalInterface` and defines a single method `showA`.

## B

The `B` interface is also marked as a `FunctionalInterface` and defines a single method `showB` with an integer parameter.

## C

The `C` interface defines a single method `showC` with two parameters (a string and an integer).

These examples help illustrate how lambda expressions provide a more concise way to implement functional interfaces, enhancing code readability and maintainability. Functional interfaces are identified using the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation, signifying that they contain a single abstract method.
